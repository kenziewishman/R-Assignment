  Hi McKenzie

I would suggest you to add the ordered teosinte and maize chromosome files to your repository as well. I think that's part of the assignment too. 

I was also not able to run your code by the 'run all command' The error was about some files not found. I have the original file and it worked for the other repository I reviewed. So you might wanna check on that!

Best

Jaspreet
